## Summary

This repository documents a comprehensive security research project that uncovered **17 security vulnerabilities** in Alipay's DeepLink URI scheme (`alipays://`) and its Nebula WebView container.

### Key Findings

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | 3 | GPS silent theft, Transfer pre-fill, Payment initiation |
| **HIGH** | 6 | Device fingerprinting, UI spoofing, Session leak |
| **MEDIUM** | 8 | Network info, Chain WebView, Scheme injection |

### Attack Chain

```
External SMS/QQ/WeChat Link
    → Browser opens alipays:// DeepLink
    → Alipay launches with attacker's URL in WebView
    → AlipayJSBridge APIs exposed to external page
    → Silent data collection (GPS, device info, session)
    → UI spoofing (title bar, toast notifications)
    → Sensitive page navigation (transaction history, transfer)
```

### Cross-Platform Verification

- Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (Android 15, New Zealand)
- Redmi 12 (Android 14, Malaysia)
- iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 18.3, China)
